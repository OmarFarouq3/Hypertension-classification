    "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is one of the most prevalent forms of cardiovascular disease in the world. Hypertension arises when blood is pumped through arteries at a higher rate than normal blood pressure, generating long-term effects and issues related to health, such as heart disease, strokes, kidney failure, and more. Hypertension is estimated to cause about 7.5 million deaths globally each year, representing about 12.8% of all deaths, as diagnosed by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",

SVM, in particular, with the RBF kernel, excellently captures these nonlinear separations not only in terms of model performance but also is well-suited for high-dimensional clinical datasets often used in healthcare.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</strong>:  In the medical data, patients often share the same diagnoses. KNN makes aviation to this field by locating patients in a similarity which is to be close to known cases (neighbors) in the feature space. It is interesting in finding out the small regions of the clusters that denote hypertension hazard due to the behavior.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><strong>Random Forest</strong>:  Hypertension can be affected by many symptoms that act together to harm the body. Random Forest is good because it can help model non-linear relationships, remove outliers, and thus, automatically rank the importance of features. This aids healthcare providers in pinpointing the most predictive factors, such as the levels of cholesterol, the patients' blood pressure at rest, or the maximum heart rate they can attain.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: Logistic Regression provides a clear and interpretable model, making it useful when transparency is crucial for medical decisions. Its coefficients directly show how each feature affects the probability of hypertension, which is essential for practitioners who need to understand the model’s rationale.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>Naive Bayes</strong>: The main reason for the Naive Bayes choice was the simplicity, speed, and effectiveness of the high-dimensional sets. Despite its basic assumption of feature independence, it is often the case that it works very well in problems such as classification in medicine. The Naive Bayes is a simple and interpretable model, which is beside the more complex classifiers such as Random Forest and SVM.</li>\n",

    "Modern techniques in machine learning have greatly accelerated early prediction and classification of hypertension with the application of clinical and lifestyle datasets. Jayakumar et al., in one such study, made a comparison of the performances of different machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM. Random Forest was consistently the best with accuracies greater than 90% in multiple clinical datasets **[1]**. Their work pointed to the power of ensemble learning in capturing the complex relationships existing in health data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related review by Adawiyah et al. described the performance of several traditional ML classifiers for predicting hypertension, and it noted that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) seemed to have the highest accuracy but was quite sensitive to data imbalance, thus resulting in overfitting tendencies **[2]**. This fit almost perfectly with the present work, where KNN gave almost perfect predictions that warranted more investigation by way of cross-validation to ascertain reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Khan and Anwar undertook a case study in the application of Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM on local population datasets with hyperparameter tuning aimed at optimizing the result **[3]**. XGBoost was thus said to have the best F1-score (92.4%), affirming its relevance in the medical classification of nonlinear patterns and complex features. This reinforces the choice of XGBoost in the contrasting models of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In extension, Hasan et al. considered early-hypertension prediction using EHRs and lifestyle features, comparing Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and neural networks **[4]**. It was found that Gradient Boosting had performed quite well in maintaining a strong recall and precision trade-off, which is most desirable when both false-positive and false-negative predictions come at a premium cost. This makes Gradient Boosting relevant in healthcare settings where actionable predictive information is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Chauhan and Patel highlighted the problem of dataset imbalance in hypertension classification and addressed it using SMOTE combined with Random Forest and XGBoost **[5]**. Their work revealed impressive improvements in recall upon equalizing class distributions, especially in minority (hypertensive) case detection. This increases awareness regarding class imbalances in real-life datasets and proposes that with even better imputation techniques applied, the results of this project can be made better in subsequent editions.\n",
